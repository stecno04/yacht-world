Constructed on the same seaworthy hull of the 53 Motor Yacht and the Sport Fish Convertible models Hatteras designed the Yacht Fisherman with a versatile cockpit but not eliminating the aft deck. This functional all fiberglass cockpit offers easy access to the swim platform through the transom gate. Traditionally a feature of sport fishing boats, motor yacht owners have discovered this cockpit offers extra convenience for swimming, scuba diving, line handling, dinghy handling and even boarding the boat is a breeze. “dharma” is hull number 318 of the very popular Hatteras 53 model. This boat has not been modernized or modified by any of the previous 5 owners and in the original form that she was created. The current owner is a knowledgeable yachtsman who has maintained the Detroit Diesel engines with his mechanic (35+ years of Detroit Diesel experience). All maintenance, repairs have been done with recommended original parts from RPM Diesel. This boat is not a charter boat or a live aboard and the current owner and the family use the boat on a regular basis. In comparison to the modern same size Motor Yachts, Hatteras 53 is a well-designed larger yacht with wide side decks with overhangs, lateral salon doors, aft wing doors, great visibility from both helm stations which makes this model a unique model for a yachtsman couple to operate easily without a captain and crew. The current owner will provide all necessary orientation and training, contact information for the Detroit Diesel mechanic, and all other Hatteras related service and parts information for the new owners.

Originally sold to a client who purchased it new from InterMarine and traded it after a short use to move up to the Prestige 630 Fly Bridge. The current owner purchased the boat in January 2022 and traded their 2020 Prestige 420 Fly Bridge to move up to a larger yacht. The current family enjoyed this boat with the help of their captain to enjoy InterMarine Escapades and travelled to Washington DC and back where they spend the summers. Due to work commitments and other family activities, they have put “La Dolce Vita II” up for sale. “La Dolce Vita II” is now seriously looking for a new owner! She was just completely buffed and waxed, all teak was cleaned, engine room was cleaned and detailed for the new owners. The current owners are out of boating; however, the boat is being washed bi-weekly and Preventive Maintenance (PM Service) is being done monthly by a Prestige Specialist. Notable Options & Extras: Twin Cummins 8.3 QSC (600 HP) with Shaft-Drives & Cummins Joystick control for docking. Yacht Controller remote docking system to dock from anywhere on the boat. Seakeeper NG 6 Gyro stabilization & Water Maker. Optional Crystal Silver MetallicAwlgrip paint on the Hull Sides.

A unique feature of this Prestige 590 is that it is a shaft-drive propulsion system coupled with Cummins innovative joystick control for docking. The shaft-drive version allows for the use of larger diameter propellers that results in a slightly lower top speed, but a more sustainable cruising speed. These larger diameter propellers are better suited to driving more weight and optimize performance in warmer waters, ideal for high-spec yachts in warmer climates. A large diameter variable-speed bow thruster is coupled to the engine throttles with a joystick interphase means easy docking. Underwater exhaust keeps noise and vibration low. “La Dolce Vita II” comes with our exclusive InterMarine Delivery Package that consists of “Escapades”, Hands-On Captain Training and Orientation, After Sale support & Service by an Appointed Prestige Yacht Dealer. It’s no secret that Prestige is a popular brand among yachting enthusiasts all over the world for innovative design features such as Private “Owner’s Suite”, better fuel consumption, sea worthiness, spacious staterooms, large areas for entertaining and user-friendly onboard systems.

The most innovative hull design on the market, the G23 Paragon serves up the very best wakesurf waves and wakeboard wakes and are completely configurable to any rider’s needs. Pair that innovation with the highest-level of luxury imaginable, and there is little doubt that the G23 Paragon is a one-of-a-kind wake boat suited for the most discerning enthusiast. Another echelon is reached with the 2023 Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon. The pinnacle of all wake boats, this award-winning model takes luxury and performance to unimaginable levels. Responsible for bringing the most innovative hull design to the market, the G23 Paragon is capable of providing surf waves and wakeboard wakes suitable for every age and skill-level. Add that to the luxury and innovation aboard this boat, and the G23 Paragon is a one-of-a-kind wake boat. Take one glance at the striking hull design of the Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon and you’ll understand what separates a Paragon from any other wake boat. The faceted hull sides have become synonymous with the G-Series, creating a visual signature that evokes pure Nautique elegance. Aggressive styling, breath-taking features and an artfully-sculpted look that will not be mistaken for anything else, the G23 Paragon is the next-level in sheer beauty. When stepping into the 2023 G23 Paragon, it becomes clear this boat was created with every detail in mind. Spend more time inside and you’ll notice that every square inch of the interior was thoughtfully designed so that your days on the water are all about sheer enjoyment. From the state-of-the-art helm, to the exceptionally versatile lounge and convertible transom seats, the Paragon was built with amenities exuding class and style. The G23 Paragon delivers the best wakesurf wave the watersports world has ever witnessed. With a perfect shape that can be completely customized to your preference, it’s great for every age or ability.

Wide coverage from the elements and with more features than ever before, the bimini aboard the G23 Paragon is the perfect companion for those sunny days. With surfboard storage on top, and pockets underneath for rope and other gear storage, this bimini has utilitarian roots while complementing the aesthetics of the Paragon. And while the Telescoping Flight Control Tower can raise and lower when needed, the bimini can stay mounted and provide coverage in either position. With an extremely low profile and beautifully designed Nauteak Non-Skid covered surfaces, the cascading steps of the elegant rear walk-through on the G23 Paragon conveys the feeling of stepping onto the back of a yacht. Getting to and from the boarding platform is easy with perfectly designed steps up and over the engine hatch. The windshield of the Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon complements its exterior aesthetic. Providing the driver with a clear view of their surroundings, this automotive-inspired windshield takes cues from the exterior of the G23 Paragon and continues those lines giving the entire boat a well thought-out, integrated look.

The G23 Paragon takes the best helm seat in the industry and elevates it to another level. Designed to provide you with unmatched comfort and support while behind the wheel, the Paragon helm seat can slide forward and reverse with the touch of a button. Whether you're driving down the lake or relaxing with friends, this versatile seat is comfortable in any position. Convert your lounge in multiple ways with the reversible stern seat on the Paragon. Quickly slide it out into the first position and flip it up so you can comfortably watch all the action. Slide it back into a second position in the lounge, and it aligns perfectly with the port and starboard flip-up lounge seats creating a long bench seating area that spans the width of the entire boat. Dual LINC Panoray displays are presented side-by-side and off-set to provide depth in a layout that delivers you with the ultimate driving experience. The 12.4” LINC Panoray interactive touchscreen on the right-hand side allows you to easily change settings and make adjustments on the fly. The gauge screen on the left is set back into the dashboard and displays all the vital information about your boat. With this screen, items like speed, fuel level, ballast levels, temperature and other important information can be seen with a quick glance. Dispersing all information and settings across two screens simplifies the driving experience with the interactive touchscreen being more efficient to navigate, and the gauge screen highlighting critical information in a large format. The Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon comes standard with the complete JL Audio® M6 Series Studio Elite stereo package with DSP technology. This includes the JL Audio MM105s head unit, six JL Audio M6 speakers throughout the boat, two 12” subwoofers, the JL Audio Wavefront™, four M6 880x tower speakers inside dual speaker housings, a transom-mounted stereo remote and a JL Audio Monoblock Amplifier. You can opt for the JL Audio WakeSub which brings two 12” subwoofers into the aft portion of the boat that are ported out the sides of the hull to bring the full sound stage to the rider so they can hear and feel the bass perfectly. With the WakeSub and zone control functionality, the sound is isolated in different areas inside the boat but also incorporates a wake zone so the rider can choose to be fully immersed in sound or not. The Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon comes standard equipped with PCM’s ZZ8. Built on the most powerful General Motors base engine ever offered for production, the ZZ8 offers the latest in direct-injection and supercharged technology providing efficiency and power.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/1970-huckins-sportsman-8843275/ ,/[..]/, 1970 Huckins Sportsman76ft ,/[..]/, UPDATED & ADDITIONAL PHOTOS COMING SOON! This 1970 Huckins 76’ Sportsman, AMANDA, was originally named Kenlane, and one of only two sister vessels made that year. This meticulously built vessel still carries the original hand-drawn blueprints along with countless Captain’s logs and various artifacts from her past. She features 3-staterooms and 3-heads. Additionally, she is equipped with twin 12V71TI Detroit engines, both with approximately 700 hours since being rebuilt. Additionally, AMANDA encompasses Huckins’ quadraconic double diagonal plank mahogany hull design. A survey conducted 04/06/23 reported the vessel “to be a well-constructed and comfortable vessel”. Inspection of the hull and stringers revealed no wood rot and were found to be in overall good condition. The vessel “planed quickly with little bow rise” and “there was no water ingress” during the survey sea trial! Although this vessel has recently undergone extensive interior renovations, her authenticity remains both in appearance and numerous onboard systems, some of which still need to be replaced or renewed. Although the current owners would like to complete her full restoration, they unfortunately no longer have the time and are looking for someone with the same love of Classic yachts to continue and finish the restoration of this magnificent vessel. This is a project boat and there is still work to be done; AMANDA is being sold “as is where is” and the asking price reflects that there is still work to be done!For More Information, please contact Capt.

By Steve Sansford Boat Test #1659 If you’re like me, I’ve always had a soft spot for pocket cruisers. With the right design, you get the combination of a big-water capable boat and the convenience of a 102-inch beam. That means you can slip it onto a trailer and haul it to a different destination for a new adventure. The 264 BR from Crownline has the right design.With an overall length of 26-feet, four-inches, and an approximate dry weight of 7559 pounds, the 264 is easily trailerable with a properly-equipped half-ton truck. Base power is a 6.2L MerCruiser rated for 300 horsepower spinning a Bravo III outdrive. In this configuration, you can expect to reach plane in about 7 seconds and top out in the mid-40s. The key to making any small cruiser seem larger is the clever use of space. Crownline nailed this with the cockpit layout on the 264 CR. The convertible sun pad in the rear is the centerpiece of this layout. Flat, spacious lounge area that easily converts into a comfortable bench. Underneath is ample trunk storage.The dual helm seat comes with its own dose of cleverness. This side-by-side unit swivels 180 degrees, creating a social and dining space utilizing a removable cockpit table, and the front-facing bench configuration on the sun pad.If you’re in the market for a trailerable weekender for the family, the 264 CR from Crownline ticks all the right boxes.

The hulls and deck are constructed in glass/epoxy over foam core sandwich; bulkheads and chainplates are carbon. There are very few yards in Europe today that build cruising boats to such a high standard using combinations of epoxy and carbon. This puts the Swiss Cat 45 in a quality class of its own that its peers simply cannot match. The epoxy build confers the necessary stiffness to the hulls and platform to get the most from the carbon mast, high-tech sails and deck hardware. All of this translates into performance underway and longevity. The carbon mast and boom are by Southern Spars, the standing rigging is Kevlar. The running rigging is Spectra and she has a full suit of sails including main, staysail, genoa and gennaker. Tali is an owner version with a 3 cabin and 2 head layout. She has had three owners and has never chartered. The quality of construction carries over to the interior finishes - Wenge floors, corian countertops, lacquered cabinets and alcantara fabrics. The cabinets and furniture are built at the factory. This is no IKEA finish nor ready-made, subcontracted modules that are found in so many production cats today.

Ask About Special Pricing and Charter Income Opportunities! When the Sun Odyssey 440 came onto the market in 2016, it immediately revolutionized the way sailors live on board and move around the boat. The Phillippe Briand and Jean-Marc Piaton design pushed yacht design to places it had never been before; with an interior optimized for cruising comfort and sailing performance, along with an on deck experience like never before. The high performance platform incorporates a full length, hard chined hull to promote fast cruising while minimizing heeling. The generous sail plan is easily handled by the inboard winches and lowered gooseneck height. Sailing this boat is an experience like none other. She is fast, powerful, and nimble. The 440 launched the proprietary Walk Around Decks, an incredible feature that has been incorporated in every successive design. This, combined with unobstructed side decks from bow to stern make movement on deck easier than ever before. The huge cockpit is perfect for entertaining guests, and the convertible cockpit lounge turns the aft eight feet of the boat into a gigantic sunpad! The open concept interior is bathed in light, as the main salon features a multitude of windows and hatches. The central U-shaped galley is optimally placed for comfort while under way, centralizing the weight of the appliances for optimized sailing performance, as well as serving meals in the salon. In the 440, the nav station is particularly emphasized, elevating this feature into a coffee nook or home office.Please contact Jerry Nassoiy or Stephanie LaChance 510-865-4700 for more information.Show More ,/[..]/, US$492,221 ,/[..]/, 2022 ,/[..]/, Jeanneau ,/[..]/, Sun Odyssey 440 ,/[..]/, Sloop ,/[..]/, 43.92ft ,/[..]/, Diesel ,/[..]/, Fiberglass ,/[..]/, Monohull ,/[..]/, Club Nautique

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/2023-bennington-25-rsba-8432011/ ,/[..]/, 2023 Bennington 25 RSBA25ft ,/[..]/, Your eye for excellence and aversion to compromise are true to spec. How do we know? Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. Lifetime Structural Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. Lifetime Deck Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. 10-Year Bow-to-Stern Warranty*: As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. Transferable Warranty: Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* No Hand-Off To Suppliers: Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. No Pro-Rating: Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/1989-trojan-10.8-meter-sedan-8959034/ ,/[..]/, 1989 Trojan 10.8 Meter Sedan36ft ,/[..]/, Trojan Yachts was founded in 1949 and by 1954 they were producing 800 boats a year. By the late 1960's they were one of the worlds leading boat builders. The company went out of business in 1992 due to the 10% luxury tax on boats implemented in the US in 1991. The Trojan 10.8 Meter Sedan was manufactured from 1986 to 1992. A very stylish boat in the 80's with her rakish profile and colourful hull graphics, she is a wide beam flybridge cruiser with abundant living space in her length. Although not specifically designed as a sportfishing boat, a transom door and tackle center were standard in the 10.8, and the enlarged cockpit has enough room for some serious fishing pursuits. The original single-stateroom floorplan of the 10.8 Sedan was updated in 1989 to include a stall shower in the head—a modification that took some elbow space out of the bow stateroom. The salon is a wide-open and spacious thanks to the boat’s wide beam. Topside, the flybridge—whose overhang shades the forward part of the cockpit—is arranged in the conventional manner with guest seating forward of the helm. Narrow side decks require care when accessing the foredeck. Standard 350hp gas engines cruise the 10.8 Meter Sedan at 17–18 knots and reach a top speed in the mid 20s. They don't build them like this anymore. Trojan, which were built by Bertram at the time, was way ahead of the pack when they introduced the International Series-First Euro design-Delta Conic Hull-Wide beams-high end construction, quality components and outstanding sea capability. Do your research and you'll find that Trojan international's are considered a " Recommended Buy ' in the preowned boat market. Last Surveyed in May, 2019, Scott Point was rated in "very good condition" by the Surveyor and offers comfortable overnighting accommodations for a family of Six. The moorage inside her boathouse at Lynnwood, Marina in North Vancouver is transferrable to a local Buyer. The owners are currently paying $801.94/month inclusive of taxes.

Then there’s the fact that it has an insulated fishbox that drains overboard and undergunwale rod storage, features that other boats its size can’t claim.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/2018-chris--craft-launch-38-8803867/ ,/[..]/, 2018 Chris-Craft Launch 3838ft ,/[..]/, This American classic iconic brand deliver the perfect weekender in the 38 Launch. The Launch 38, the second-largest boat in the 142-year-old builder’s lineup, is built to do what Chris-Craft boats have always been built to do: safely and comfortably host a group of people — it’s rated for a 15-passenger capacity, and all of them will have a place for their rear end — for an enjoyable day on the water. Its outdoor galley unit makes it possible to keep everyone fed and hydrated, and an extendable SureShade aft and a Bimini on the bow ensure folks who want sun can get it and those who don’t can take cover. But it can do more than be a dayboat. At a top speed of 52.4 mph, the Yamahas were burning a combined 78.1 gph at 5900 rpm. The most efficient cruise speed was 34 mph, which had the F300s turning at 4000 rpm and burning 35.4 gph, for 0.96 mpg. Fuel burn was 47.1, 55.9 and 69.5 gph at 39.9, 44.4 and 48.8 mph, respectively. Twin flush-mount Garmin GPSmap XSV multifunction displays occupy the sloped dash. Above them are engine gauges. On a small flat section to port (though I’ve seen it to starboard on other 38s) is the Optimus 360 joystick, which makes docking a breeze, and on sloped faces to either side of the wooden and stainless steering wheel are a stereo head unit and the engine throttles. Once the bow levels out on plane, the driver’s view all around is excellent. So is access to the bow. Sidedecks to either side, which are elevated two steps from the helm area, to create headroom in the cabin below, are easy to transit, and a safety rail runs from just aft of amidships to the bow. The galley unit — built into the same console that serves as the base for the helm seats — is going to be the center of activity on the boat. Under an easy-to-lift gasassisted lid is a grill, a sink with a spigot and a two-burner cooktop. Built into the base of the unit are more make-the-day-last-longer amenities, including a refrigerator, an ice-maker and a microwave, each with its own access door. Aft of the galley is a settee that is split into two halves by the walkthrough from the swim platform. A table rises up out of the deck at the push of a button and folds open to double its size. With room for two people in full lounging mode, four people in comfort mode or six people in cozy mode, the settees will comprise the main social zone on the boat. Unless it doesn’t. By that I mean some folks might prefer the bow, where a big sun lounge — easily room for three or four people — and a rear-facing bench settee create a comfortable and breezy conversation pit. Belowdecks is where the Launch 38, separates itself from many of its competitors. Down a set of teak steps is a split head — toilet and sink to starboard, shower stall to port — a queen berth forward, and two more berths aft, under the helm and galley area. A single berth is to starboard and opposite that is a full-size berth. Both include a reading light and a nightstand is between them.

The legendary performance and award-winning lineage that the G23 has built its reputation on for a decade continues in the most advanced and luxurious model to date. With world-class wakes and waves, a stunning exterior and all of the interior amenities you could desire, the G23 is ready to outperform anything else in its class. With the Nautique Surf System (NSS), all inland waterways turn into a surfer’s paradise. Finding your love of surfing isn’t just along the coast anymore, and the feeling of throwing the rope back to the boat and standing in the pocket for the first time is one that will stay with you forever. The freedom of carving endless waves with your friends has a lasting impression on everyone that gets behind the boat. Thanks to the technology that can be found aboard all Super Air Nautiques, the Nautique Surf System shapes long, perfectly formed waves to enjoy all summer long. When it comes time to choose your Nautique, you can feel comfortable knowing you have the best possible engine options available to you. We offer powerful, reliable performance with our gas engine offerings from our sister company, Pleasurecraft® Marine Engines (PCM) that provide you with outstanding performance day in and day out. If you’re interested in our diesel offering on select Nautique models, we’re also proud to have the powerful Yanmar Marine 8LV available as well! If your time on the water is spent by the coast, then the Nautique Coastal Edition is made for you. A special package available on any Super Air Nautique model, the Coastal Edition includes corrosion-resistant features throughout the boat that protect vital parts from the abuse of saltwater use. Whether or not you utilize your Nautique in a tropical paradise, an intra-coastal or marsh waterway, the Coastal Edition keeps your Nautique as happy as you are riding in it. We’ve teamed up with JL Audio to provide the best possible sound experience on all Nautique models. Every Nautique has the JL Audio MM105s head unit that delivers crisp and clear sound to the JL Audio speakers onboard, all of which are powered by JL Audio amplifiers. Each element of our comprehensive JL Audio stereo system has been designed to perform seamlessly with one another to produce the best listening experience possible. With great standard packages, there are also upgraded options depending on the boat model that can include JL Audio subwoofers, tower speakers, additional zone control and Nautique’s exclusive JL WaveFront™ and WakeSub™ technology. Our team of designers are fanatics about providing you with the best possible on-water experience. When you step aboard a Nautique, the ergonomics, aesthetics and functionality of each component are working in your favor at every turn. All this, so that fun-filled days on the water for your friends and family are easily within reach. When sourcing the components that go into each Nautique, we take pride in the search. We locate and incorporate only the most durable, high-quality and luxurious materials available so that your Nautique will withstand the elements and provide years of enjoyment. Every model that rolls off our factory floor includes our dedication to quality so your family can enjoy it well into the future. From the ground up, our boats are built with exceptionally high integrity and strength. One of the ways that we do this is Nautique’s industry-leading process of incorporating the internal ballast system into our stringer grid. Our engineers developed this build process in order to keep the internal ballast underneath the floors and out of the storage areas, as well as use the structure of the ballast tanks to increase the overall strength of the hull. You won’t find another manufacturer that has gone through such great lengths to ensure quality and convenience are top of mind with every design feature.Jim Cabral | 714-296-4660 | jimc@scmg.comShow More ,/[..]/, US$139,900 ,/[..]/, 2017 ,/[..]/, Nautique ,/[..]/, Super Air Nautique G23 ,/[..]/, Ski and Wakeboard ,/[..]/, 25.25ft ,/[..]/, Gas ,/[..]/, Fiberglass ,/[..]/, Modified Vee ,/[..]/, Lifetime ,/[..]/, Sun Country Inland, Lake Havasu City

In three easy steps, you’ll have the ideal wave for your family’s surfing success. And all of this with no trade-offs in your cruising enjoyment. Our most premium Sterndrive series, these luxury boats are an expression of style and workmanship. From their striking presence on the water to the effortless acceleration and intuitive handling, any of our three A Series models will transport you to a place where you and your passengers can relax in the moment and enjoy the ride. The A Series features the handling capabilities of a runabout with the width, finishes, appointments, and design of a premium yacht—upholding the Cobalt legacy of performance and handling that provides drivers with confidence and passengers with unmatched comfort. Built with Cobalt’s next-generation hull design reinforced with Kevlar™, the captain-focused helm with dual Garmin Glass Cockpit touchscreens, a double-stitched console, and a hydraulic swim platform that lowers well below the surface for easy access, the A Series purposefully delivers top-line handling, stability, and durability. Our most popular Sterndrive series, Cobalt’s storied core boat models that evolved to become the R Series embody all you need for a sporty day on the water. Sleek and luxurious, the R Series is the ultimate line of sport boats designed with smooth, stylish lines to cast an aggressive stance—no matter what the activity. The R Series’ exterior features a walk thru transom platform and aft sunpad, and a roomy, expansive interior to accommodate groups of all sizes with wraparound, double-stitched upholstered yacht-style seating designed to last as long as the memories you’ll make At the helm, discover aluminum dash panels, stainless switches, a form-fitted upholstered eyebrow, dual Garmin Glass Cockpit touchscreens, and standard GPS—plus a leather-wrapped steering wheel and best-in-class audio system with Bluetooth capabilities. The R Series also features a patented Swim Step platform that lowers beneath the water’s surface for easy access to swimmers of all ages. The perfect entry into the Cobalt lifestyle, the 10 Series gives you the performance and luxury you expect in models made for smaller lakes and easy trailering. Each 10 Series model comes with an impressive suite of standard features, plus a wealth of options that enable you to personalize your boating experience and make each day on the water your own. This series is primed to perform whether you are a skier—or just along for the ride—with explosive hole-shots, tight high-speed turns, and a standout ride. And all while remaining as fuel-efficient as possible. The digital helm includes a leather steering wheel, upholstered eyebrow, stainless-steel switches with aluminum color-matched panels, and the port-side passenger seat easily converts to transform the cockpit into spacious arena-style seating. Plus, our patented Swim Step coupled with an extended swim platform provides game-changing convenience, safety, and accessibility for boaters of all ages. Our unparalleled quality and innovative designs go far beyond the core of our boats. Make your own Cobalt experience with an array of optional equipment and lifestyle accessories designed to give you everything you need for your way of life. Plus, learn more about our Custom Wave Technology surf system for our surf boats in the Surf Class. Finally, no more hot seats on darker colored vinyl while you’re out enjoying a full day of fun on the water. This anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, mildew-resistant, and sulfide stain-resistant fabric technology keeps your vinyl a full 15-20 degrees cooler than traditional vinyl even when it’s out in the sun. Cobalt has partnered with Harman Kardon to bring their signature sound to the water. Time alignment and spectral response allow guests to sit next to any speaker without an unpleasant experience, meaning there isn’t a bad seat in the boat. Includes marine ruggedized components and speakers that are classic yet timeless and can handle the harshest conditions–creating a top-tier audio system like none other in the marine industry. Cobalt’s award-winning Splash & Stow™ eliminates the traditional way of transporting, deploying, and retrieving heavy-duty, yacht-style inflatables. At the quick touch of a button, the inflatable is deployed and connected to the built-in power inflator, leading to hours of fun and enjoyment on the water. Available with either the Splash & Stow™ Inflatable Round Island or Inflatable Long Rectangle Mat. No need to take down your sunshade with the Arch with Rotating Sunshade. Built on our aluminum folding arch, the canvas remains up when the arch is folded down to lower positions, and the sunshade has a rigid frame for tight canvas fit and articulates as the arch is folded down, remaining flat. Gas assist cylinder or full electric actuation options make it easily operable for one person. Our Zenith Arch, with fold-out bimini included, manually folds to a lower position to aid in garage storage. The simple, clean design is classic Cobalt and comes in either black or white and has easier-to-grip rotating turn handles and cam-locks for locking the Arch in the up-position. New board rack adapters integrate well with the styling of the Arch vs. pipe-clamp style mounts. Cobalt’s already easy-to-use Swim Step just got easier. With the push of a button, the step folds into the water or returns from the water into the stowed position—all from the convenience of the aft sun pad. Designed to be sleek, simple, and effortless, the e-Step deployment has a near-silent actuation, making it the quietest actuated step on the market.Show More ,/[..]/, US$209,817 ,/[..]/, 2023 ,/[..]/, Cobalt ,/[..]/, R8 ,/[..]/, Bowrider ,/[..]/, 27.83ft ,/[..]/, Gas ,/[..]/, Fiberglass ,/[..]/, Deep Vee ,/[..]/, 10 years ,/[..]/, Sun Country Inland, Irvine

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. Lifetime Structural Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. Lifetime Deck Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. 10-Year Bow-to-Stern Warranty*: As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. Transferable Warranty: Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* No Hand-Off To Suppliers: Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. No Pro-Rating: Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Partnership With Our Dealers: Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. Excellence In Customer Satisfaction: Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception. Given by the National Marine Manufacturer Association, the CSI Award recognizes manufacturers who receive exceptional satisfaction scores for the boat, engine, & dealer experience. A great place to start when researching what’s the right Bennington for you and your boating family is to explore our luxury pontoon boat lineup and product offerings. From our entry-level S Series to our flagship QX models; our fleet of boats are designed to fit various use cases, luxurious finishes, and feature options to suit your needs. We invite you to view our complete lineup and to become part of the Bennington family. Bennington Pontoons can be matched with just about any marine engine brand and are available for Outboard, I/O (Sterndrive) or Twin engine setups. Engines are also available at different horsepower levels and should be chosen depending on where you boat and the performance and handling you desire, as well as matched with the boat you order.

The most innovative hull design on the market, the G23 Paragon serves up the very best wakesurf waves and wakeboard wakes and are completely configurable to any rider’s needs. Pair that innovation with the highest-level of luxury imaginable, and there is little doubt that the G23 Paragon is a one-of-a-kind wake boat suited for the most discerning enthusiast. Another echelon is reached with the 2023 Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon. The pinnacle of all wake boats, this award-winning model takes luxury and performance to unimaginable levels. Responsible for bringing the most innovative hull design to the market, the G23 Paragon is capable of providing surf waves and wakeboard wakes suitable for every age and skill-level. Add that to the luxury and innovation aboard this boat, and the G23 Paragon is a one-of-a-kind wake boat. Take one glance at the striking hull design of the Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon and you’ll understand what separates a Paragon from any other wake boat. The faceted hull sides have become synonymous with the G-Series, creating a visual signature that evokes pure Nautique elegance. Aggressive styling, breath-taking features and an artfully-sculpted look that will not be mistaken for anything else, the G23 Paragon is the next-level in sheer beauty. When stepping into the 2023 G23 Paragon, it becomes clear this boat was created with every detail in mind. Spend more time inside and you’ll notice that every square inch of the interior was thoughtfully designed so that your days on the water are all about sheer enjoyment. From the state-of-the-art helm, to the exceptionally versatile lounge and convertible transom seats, the Paragon was built with amenities exuding class and style. The G23 Paragon delivers the best wakesurf wave the watersports world has ever witnessed. With a perfect shape that can be completely customized to your preference, it’s great for every age or ability. Pair that with wakeboard wakes that will satisfy the sport’s best all the way to those just looking to have fun, and the 2023 G23 Paragon is the pinnacle of wake sports perfection. Wide coverage from the elements and with more features than ever before, the bimini aboard the G23 Paragon is the perfect companion for those sunny days. With surfboard storage on top, and pockets underneath for rope and other gear storage, this bimini has utilitarian roots while complementing the aesthetics of the Paragon. And while the Telescoping Flight Control Tower can raise and lower when needed, the bimini can stay mounted and provide coverage in either position. With an extremely low profile and beautifully designed Nauteak Non-Skid covered surfaces, the cascading steps of the elegant rear walk-through on the G23 Paragon conveys the feeling of stepping onto the back of a yacht. Getting to and from the boarding platform is easy with perfectly designed steps up and over the engine hatch. The windshield of the Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon complements its exterior aesthetic. Providing the driver with a clear view of their surroundings, this automotive-inspired windshield takes cues from the exterior of the G23 Paragon and continues those lines giving the entire boat a well thought-out, integrated look. Relax in the most comfortable seats in the house with the Convertible Transom Seats that come standard on the G23 Paragon. These seats flip up out of the large step areas on each side of the transom and include adjustable headrests for added comfort. Relax while the boat is parked, then easily flip them down when you’re ready to start moving. Convertible Transom Seats are a sure-fire way to relax in luxury during your days on the water. The G23 Paragon takes the best helm seat in the industry and elevates it to another level. Designed to provide you with unmatched comfort and support while behind the wheel, the Paragon helm seat can slide forward and reverse with the touch of a button. Whether you're driving down the lake or relaxing with friends, this versatile seat is comfortable in any position. Convert your lounge in multiple ways with the reversible stern seat on the Paragon. Quickly slide it out into the first position and flip it up so you can comfortably watch all the action. Slide it back into a second position in the lounge, and it aligns perfectly with the port and starboard flip-up lounge seats creating a long bench seating area that spans the width of the entire boat. Dual LINC Panoray displays are presented side-by-side and off-set to provide depth in a layout that delivers you with the ultimate driving experience. The 12.4” LINC Panoray interactive touchscreen on the right-hand side allows you to easily change settings and make adjustments on the fly. The gauge screen on the left is set back into the dashboard and displays all the vital information about your boat. With this screen, items like speed, fuel level, ballast levels, temperature and other important information can be seen with a quick glance. Dispersing all information and settings across two screens simplifies the driving experience with the interactive touchscreen being more efficient to navigate, and the gauge screen highlighting critical information in a large format. The Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon comes standard with the complete JL Audio® M6 Series Studio Elite stereo package with DSP technology. This includes the JL Audio MM105s head unit, six JL Audio M6 speakers throughout the boat, two 12” subwoofers, the JL Audio Wavefront™, four M6 880x tower speakers inside dual speaker housings, a transom-mounted stereo remote and a JL Audio Monoblock Amplifier. You can opt for the JL Audio WakeSub which brings two 12” subwoofers into the aft portion of the boat that are ported out the sides of the hull to bring the full sound stage to the rider so they can hear and feel the bass perfectly. With the WakeSub and zone control functionality, the sound is isolated in different areas inside the boat but also incorporates a wake zone so the rider can choose to be fully immersed in sound or not. The Super Air Nautique G23 Paragon comes standard equipped with PCM’s ZZ8. Built on the most powerful General Motors base engine ever offered for production, the ZZ8 offers the latest in direct-injection and supercharged technology providing efficiency and power.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. Lifetime Structural Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. Lifetime Deck Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. 10-Year Bow-to-Stern Warranty*: As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. Transferable Warranty: Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* No Hand-Off To Suppliers: Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. No Pro-Rating: Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Partnership With Our Dealers: Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. Excellence In Customer Satisfaction: Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception.

" At Ease" is in excellent condition, maintained, cruised, and loved by experienced boaters. The pride of ownership is evident in every detail, and she will be a pleasure to show and a greater pleasure to own. Call listing broker for your private showing of this equisite yacht today! The 48 Salon Express has a traditional exterior profile that belies her contemporary performance. She's reported to cruise at 25 knot's, and 28 knot's at wide open throttle. Pod drives and joystick controls give the owner the confidence to dock her in the most difficult of circumstances, and remarkably low sound levels while underway allow for a more pleasant experience while cruising. Featuring a standard configuration of two cabins and two heads, "At Ease" is supplemented by a utility space forward of the engine room that is laid out with a work station, refrigerator, freezer, washer, and dryer. Designed with long range cruising in mind, her galley-down layout doesn’t compromise on space and light, making food and drink preparation a pure pleasure. Unique to the Sabre 48 design, her master berth and en-suite head have an athwartships orientation, allowing for flat cabin sole on all side of the spacious island queen.

Broker Notes: Desirable tan dash board, generator, neutral decor throughout! Sale includes owners manuals. The PowerBoat Guide had this to say: A popular boat for Sea Ray, the 340 Sundancer (note that an earlier 340 Sundancer was produced from 1984-89) is a good example of why Sea Ray continues to lead the market for mid-cabin express boats. Attractively styled and built to high standards, the 340 is a superb entertainment platform with a wide-open interior and a cockpit large enough to accommodate a small crowd. Two floorplans were available, both with the forward stateroom open to the main cabin and a mid stateroom disguised as a sunken conversation area by day. Privacy curtains separate the sleeping areas from the salon, and a hidden TV/VCR pulls out and swivels so it can be viewed from anywhere in the boat. Posh furnishings highlight the Sundancer's interior. Topside, an adjustable helm seat overlooks a tiered dash configuration, and facing bench seats, a cockpit table, and wet bar make the cockpit a comfortable place for guests.Contact listing agent John Oeftering directly at (248) 709-6330 or email john@temptationyachtsales.com for additional information or to schedule a showing.Show More ,/[..]/, US$79,900 ,/[..]/, 1999 ,/[..]/, Sea Ray ,/[..]/, 340 Sundancer ,/[..]/, Cruiser ,/[..]/, 34ft ,/[..]/, Gas ,/[..]/, Fiberglass ,/[..]/, Temptation Yacht Sales Inc

The 3900 Open fishes and cruises with aplomb. On the helm deck is an L-shaped companion lounge that offers excellent visibility for up to five guests — add the removable teak table and they can have lunch while they’re there. Want innovation? The next time you’re fishing, check out the short leg of the “L,“ which swivels and slides on a pedestal so that a hard-charging skipper can have his first mate sit facing forward beside him to help spot rips, color changes, and other signs of fish. The captain’s chair is an adjustable seat with a high backrest and armrests that lock up out of the way. Plus, the seat swivels sideways so you can maintain control of the boat while facing aft, such as when you’re backing down or yelling at your crew when they miss with the gaff.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/1974-custom-phillips-tcr-45-8908915/ ,/[..]/, 1974 Custom Phillips TCR 4548ft ,/[..]/, Tough as nails. Light as a feather. Solid, Proven, Venerable even. Lively. Single-handable. Built for a family. Everything you need. Nothing you don't. Nothing to rot. Protected center cockpit helm. Huge space above decks. Cozy and separate accommodations below. All of you sailors who know a thing or two about the sea will respect this trimaran. All of you sailors with a strong desire to sail the world, a love of multihulls and a mismatched budget should get in immediate contact. Don't let the age fool you. Don't be slow. This is a special trimaran. She was built by Southwest Multihull Construction in Cornwall, UK and designed by Edward Phillips. She has crossed the Atlantic. She has crossed the Pacific. She confronts river bars with regularity. She can be beached. She points well due to her ama keels. She weighs only 14,000 lbs - fully loaded. . . at 48' LOA. . . This is because she was way ahead of her time and constructed of Airex foam and unidirectional fiberglass. Her amas are solid foam. Her beams are unidirectional fiberglass box beams. This is strong construction that also insulates against cold and sound. Her main hull has a 9:1 fineness ratio. She sleeps 6 in three cabins. 2 in the sterncastle. 2 amidships, and 2 in the forward stateroom. She has a completely enclosed and separate head compartment. Her helm and center cockpit are very protected and secure. This is actual performance data: 11 knots in 11 knots of true wind. 16 knots to windward in 20 knots of true wind. 20 knots off the wind in gale conditions under staysail alone. Canary Islands to Barbados in 19 days. Victoria, BC to Hawaii in 17 days. Cabo San Lucas, Mexico to Victoria, British Columbia in 20 days. Those last two were single-handed by the way. . . Her diesel is old school. A Norwegian SABB. 18 horsepower burning 1/3 of a gallon per hour at 5 knots. There is no reverse. Instead she has continuously adjustable propeller blades. Go from forward to reverse at any speed. Fine tune her for up to 7 knots in flat water, but for God's sake sail her whenever possible. Her aluminum mast and cutter rig stands only 50' off the deck but allows you to spread up to 1,012 square feet of sail. When needed, her 27 gallons of diesel can take you 350 miles under power (and a few Jerry cans will get you much further). She carries 170 gallons of water for long passages. What else can I say? She turns 50 next year. I won't be surprised if she sails until she's 100. Are you the right crew? Contact Matthew.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. : As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. : As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. : Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* : Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. : Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception. Given by the National Marine Manufacturer Association, the CSI Award recognizes manufacturers who receive exceptional satisfaction scores for the boat, engine, & dealer experience. A great place to start when researching what’s the right Bennington for you and your boating family is to explore our luxury pontoon boat lineup and product offerings. From our entry-level S Series to our flagship QX models; our fleet of boats are designed to fit various use cases, luxurious finishes, and feature options to suit your needs. We invite you to view our complete lineup and to become part of the Bennington family. Bennington Pontoons can be matched with just about any marine engine brand and are available for Outboard, I/O (Sterndrive) or Twin engine setups.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts.

Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. : As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking.

The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. : Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* : Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. : Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/2019-ocean-alexander-70e-8789199/ ,/[..]/, 2019 Ocean Alexander 70e70ft ,/[..]/, Captain maintained, loaded with options and equipment, and maintained with an open checkbook, this 70e is the finest example of the model on the market today! Despite its size and scope, the boat can easily be operated by an experienced owner-operator thanks to the Volvo IPS Joystick, Dynamic positioning system, and cockpit docking station. *Click “Immersive Tour” for a 3D virtual tour Built to the mega-yacht standards of Ocean Alexander, the 70e features a level of finish and engineering seldom found in it’s class. Until recently, the 70e was the entry level boat for Ocean Alexander, meaning all the engineering, soft goods, and design cues from their much larger mega yachts were implemented in the construction of the boat. Featuring Volvo IPS technology, the boat is incredibly easy for an experienced owner-operator to run and care for. IPS makes the boat extremely maneuverable not only at low speeds around the dock, but also at high speed thanks to Joystick driving which lets the boat turn on rails when needed. SidePower vector fins create lift and a rock solid ride when underway, but also at rest with their zero speed functionality. Furthermore, Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) is installed to hold the boat’s position and heading while waiting for bridges, fuel docks, or setting. Rather than gelcoat which requires constant upkeep to stay ahead of oxidation, the 70e is painted in Alexseal, making it much easier to maintain, and restore, the shine of the boat without needing to compound. Signification options, upgrades, and services are below. A full list is available in the “features” tab: 2020 Williams 435 Sportjet with upgraded 150HP Rotax engine Upgraded engine package – IPS 1350s (1200HP) Upgraded onboard internet system (2021) Spare set of propellers Pods serviced and updated (2023) Custom SeaCrylic bridge enclosure with three pin-up panels and a four piece aft enclosure, all designed to slide to the port side Bridge air conditioning upgraded and duct work redone for increased efficiency, with added vents at helm (2022) All air conditionings acid flushed (2022) Bottom paint, zincs, and propspeed (2023) New AC water pump (2022) Watermaker serviced and new control board (2022) Exterior detail (2023) Paint Protection Film (PPF) added to high traffic areas (2022) Zero Speed stabilizer package Marquipt boarding steps and boarding ladder Custom cockpit drop curtain for privacy Crew quarters with bunk, toilet, sink, and head Sliding starboard berths to convert to single queen Wine cooler in galley Seagull water purifier for galley sink and all icemakers Dynamic Positioning System, High Speed Mode, Joystick Driving, Trim Assist, and Cruise Control Cockpit joystick station Sonos AV System Upgrade (4x) Garmin monitors from 17” to 24” Sea Recovery 450G/Day watermaker Variable speed bow thruster with control at all three stations Manual sun awning for bow and aft bridge Flip down 32” TV in cockpit and bridge hardtop On the bow is a large sunpad for laying out. On two gas-assisted struts, the sun lounge raises to reveal an immense amount of storage for storing the awnings, lines, fenders, etc. Behind the sun lounge sit opposing bench seats with a high-gloss table between them and drink holders flanking either side. A manual sun awning with poles (designated storage below sun lounge), covers the entire bow area, making it a great spot to relax at anchor or slow speed. The port side pantograph door makes access to the bow very easy from the salon, without having to walk back to the cockpit and around to the bow. Walking aft towards the cockpit is made easy with the boat’s high gunnels and well-placed grab handles. Sprayed non-skid finish is applied to the foredecks and bow area. This makes the area much easier to keep clean as opposed to teak which would be subject to spray and direct, unshaded sunlight. The cockpit has transom access on either side of the vessel, through hearty stainless-steel gates. Port and starboard capstans are in the cockpit to assist with docking. A transom bench faces forward opposite a high gloss teak table with multi-directional grain. Line storage lockers flank either side of the cockpit. Double-wide bridge access steps lay on the port side, while a flip down TV and wetbar complete with sink, icemaker, and refrigerator occupy the starboard side. The massive bridge has wrap around, aft seating, with a high-gloss teak table that converts to a sunpad on the starboard side. The bridge wetbar is similar to that found on much larger boats as it features a C-shaped marble countertop that raises for a bar complete with two fixed stools. The wetbar also features a residential size electric grill, refrigerator, icemaker, and sink. Slide the custom SeaCrylic enclosure to the port side and enter the forward bridge. A covered L-shaped lounge with high-gloss dining table sit to starboard, opposite another wetbar marble countertop, refrigerator and icemaker. A 32” TV pops down from the hardtop ceiling to face the covered lounging and dining area. Thanks to the full bridge enclosure, this area can be climate controlled, protected, and dry making it useable even in adverse conditions. But, in only a few minutes, the aft sliding enclosure can disappear to the port side, and three large panels of the forward enclosure pin to the underside of the hardtop to create an open-air bridge for nice days. The forward helm sits offset to port with two 24” Garmin 8600 series monitors. The Volvo Glass Cockpit integrates all engine and vessel information into the Garmin displays, resulting in a very clean and aesthetically pleasing helm. Engine information, sonar, radar, cameras and more are integrated into the Garmin network, along with OctoPlex G2 – the digital switching system that controls the whole boat. The OctoPlex system also has a designated display in the salon, along with integration for the vessels onboard iPad, giving the captain a mobile distribution panel when servicing and maintaining the boat. Through the port side bridge hatch sits the interior staircase to the salon which gives the boat both an exterior and interior bridge staircase – seldom found on this size. The lower helm, also offset to the port side, features all the same instrumentation and controls as the upper helm, along with the designated OctoPlex display for all the digital switching onboard. Like the upper helm seat, the lower helm seat is a sturdy Stidd chair with arm rest controls for the joystick and Garmin GRID remote to control the Garmin screens. The dinette sits on the starboard side of the salon, forward of the galley. It features a large folding table that allows for plenty of walkway space when folded, but also opens to an expansive dining table when needed. The spacious galley features all the amenities of home plus some. A separate convection oven and microwave are complimented by a full-size refrigerator, drawer freezer, wine cooler, garbage disposal, induction cooktop, dishwasher, and trash compactor. All these features make extended stays on board comfortable. Aft of the galley is a spacious salon with opposing sofas and a large TV that drops down from the ceiling so it is hidden when not in use. A full compliment of audio visual equipment includes a media switching system, Sonos, Apple TV and surround sound speakers. Below deck, the full-beam, aft master features large hull side windows to bring the owner close to the water. A port side chaise lounge with vanity is perfect for relaxing in privacy, while the starboard side of the stateroom is flanked by a full chest of drawers and cabinets. The spacious walk-in closet is well appointed with cedar lining, backlit drawers, and a safe. A large TV is situated on the forward bulkhead, along with a media switching system for the surround sound, inputs include Satellite TV, Apple TV, and Sonos. The master head features his and her sinks, a heated floor, and large walk-in shower. The VIP stateroom has a center-line forward berth with nightstands on either side, a rare find in most VIP staterooms. The private, ensuite VIP head has a large shower, basin-style sink, and well-lit mirror for getting read. Dual hanging closets, a forward facing TV, and overhead opening hatch will keep even the most discerning guests comfortable. The starboard side guest stateroom houses two wide, single berths that easily slide together to form a queen. A filler allows the beds to be made in a way where most would never know the beds can even slide apart. When slid together, an inboard nightstand is revealed for the queen size bed. A large hanging closet, TV, and opening porthole make it a truly comfortable stateroom for any guests. Thecabin also features access to the day head through a private ensuite door. The day head can also be accessed from the hallway. The port side stateroom has bunks, each with a nightstand, a closet, and a TV to for nighttime relaxing. An aft crew quarters is accessed through a water-tight transom door. With a toilet, shower, TV, and closet, not only will any captain be content, but it also allows the owner to treat the cabin as a bonus, fifth stateroom. Engine room access is through a watertight door from the crew quarters. Diamond skid panels remove to reveal all seacocks and bilges. Stainless vertical and horizontal grab handles make maneuvering the engine room extremely easy, even underway. A custom diesel fueling pump, plumbed to the boats tank, makes it easy to fill fuel tenders or prime fuel filters. A custom fishing rod holder is cleverly installed on the port side of the engine room. A shelf housing all compressors for the split gas air conditioning system keeps service easy and the cabin side of the air conditioning system quiet, only the fan is heard. The cable master, watermaker, generators, pods, and engines are all easily accessible in a well-laid out engine room with incredible headroom. *This is a rare opportunity to own a large yacht that is still designed and tailored to the owner-operator.

The interiors are warm and welcoming, yet with a modern and sophisticated overall look. The principal living area is located on the main deck; it’s function can be increased by setting up a dining table for 10 people, cleverly folded away inside a bench in front of the sofa. We then move on to the central staircase, designed to reach the other two bridges, and is a focal and iconic point that connects all the floors and also serves to divide the areas via a metal mesh screen. Moving on to the upper deck we find the Sky lounge, with fully opening windows that can be used as a living room, dining area, or cinema, thanks to modular furniture. The flybridge can also be used as a lounge or outdoor dining area, thanks to the coffee table which can be converted to a dining table if desired. The principle of flexibility returns to the lower deck where the living room can be totally transformed by closing a system of sliding panels, creating a VIP cabin with bathroom. On the same level, there are also two guest cabins, while the owner’s cabin is located on the main deck. Much wider in width than those offered on yachts of similar sizes, the owner's cabin has large windows that create a feeling of uniformity with the surrounding environment. Don't Tell Mom is a highly customized yacht with hand-selected details chosen by an experienced yachter. Notable features include an extensively upgraded AV system, including a KVH HD7 SAT TV and a 4G wi-fi with hot spot. The exterior of the yacht is complete with teak decking throughout, a sun awning for the upper deck- aft, upgraded skylounge side doors (in lieu of standard fixed glass), and a sliding bulwark starboard. Upgraded electronics include a portable MTU control station and additional wing station with engine throttles and bow thruster.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/1996-albin-tournament-express-8820684/ ,/[..]/, 1996 Albin Tournament Express31ft ,/[..]/, Known as the "Fishing Machine for the Cruising Family" this new to market Albin Tournament Express has been cared for meticulously by its owners for the past 7 years. The Tournament Express was designed as a saltwater sport fishing boat by a company with over a century of North Sea and Atlantic experience. The Albin's blue-water heritage is immediately apparent: a very high bow to buck big waves, a high, welded stainless-steel bow rail, nonskid surfacing and side decks wide enough to let you stand straight up holding both the side rail and the handrail on the cabin roof. "Heartbeat" is custom fitted with a Tuna Tower installed here in San Diego by Chingon Custom Metal Fab. An enormous covered live well and bait well combination is fitted into the transom top. Under the deck are more wells with removable bins, and two systems inspection hatches. Topside includes a seawater wash-down as well as a transom mounted shower, overhead and foot lighting for night use and convenient drained rope lockers port and starboard. Included is a Cannon Magnum electric downrigger. The cockpit features recently replaced pads on the large gunwhales to brace yourself comfortably while leaning out.The pilot house opens with a set of large solid doors allowing the space to be completely enclosed and benefit from the heat of the main cabin on those cold winter days or wide open and an extension of the open cockpit on those warm summer days. The helm has excellent visibility and electronics at your fingertips. Along with the helm station the pilothouse features a refrigerator, sink, cutting board, storage for tackle or loose items and large port side seating area. The side glass slides open and a vent window forward allows plenty of air flow when needed. Below decks the Albin has a starboard roomy, enclosed head with curtained shower, Jabsco pump MSD, mirror and sink built into a vanity. Forward is a large dinette which converts to a double berth. The galley is to Port with another refrigerator, microwave, toaster oven, built-in coffee maker, 2 hot plates, a large sink and plenty of storage. The cabin is one main room except for the head - a double berth, also open, stretches across the aft bulkhead. You will find storage in or under just about everything, a nod to its incarnation as a cruising boat as much as a fishing one.The Albin has a great reputation for high quality, outstanding handling characteristics, economical diesel performance, and comfort for cruising or fishing. The pilot house boasts a full hard top and windshield that is perfect for year round use. The single Cummins 6BTA Turbo Diesel provides efficient and reliable power with easy cruising up to about 16 to 19 knots and a top speed of 23 knots. This vessel is ready to take you to the fishing grounds this summer or cruise the bay and catch a concert.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. Lifetime Structural Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. Lifetime Deck Warranty: As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. 10-Year Bow-to-Stern Warranty*: As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. Transferable Warranty: Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* No Hand-Off To Suppliers: Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. No Pro-Rating: Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Partnership With Our Dealers: Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. Excellence In Customer Satisfaction: Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception. Given by the National Marine Manufacturer Association, the CSI Award recognizes manufacturers who receive exceptional satisfaction scores for the boat, engine, & dealer experience. A great place to start when researching what’s the right Bennington for you and your boating family is to explore our luxury pontoon boat lineup and product offerings. From our entry-level S Series to our flagship QX models; our fleet of boats are designed to fit various use cases, luxurious finishes, and feature options to suit your needs.

Her fiberglass hull was laid up 42% heavier than her original design specifications. After years of of work and nearly 1000 board feet of teak used, her magnificent interior was completed. Every single detail was thoroughly thought out and meticulously completed with the finest materials available. Constant upgrades have been made by her extremely knowledgeable owners throughout her life. As you will read below, she differs a great deal from her original plans, but she is the safe, strong, powerful, high performance world cruiser Bruce Roberts intended her to be. Redundancy was a major design consideration throughout her build. She is the perfect choice as a live-aboard, a coastal cruiser, or world wide voyaging. If you’re in the market for such a vessel, come take a look. You will not be disappointed!

The PowerBoat Guide had this to say: Still one of the best high-performance center consoles on the water, the Fountain 38 is a fast-action fishing machine designed for anglers who want to get where the fish are, regardless of the weather. This was Fountain’s largest fishing boat when she came out in 2001 and there’s no mistaking her race-boat pedigree. The 38CC rides on a slender deep-V hull with twin ventilating steps and Fountain’s signature notched transom and pad keel. Inside, a large U-shaped bow seating area provides space for carry-ons under the cushions. Protective coaming panels are a plus while fighting fish, and the 38CC can be equipped with a starboard-side dive door. There are seven in-deck fish-boxes and the transom holds a 50-gallon live-well. The console head compartment contains a VacuFlush toilet, sink and shower. Additional features include a standard T-top with radio box, transom workstation, pop-up cleats, and a large anchor locker.

Accuracy beyond measureThere are many advantages to using robots in manufacturing, but possibly the greatest is consistency. Whether spraying gel coat or fiberglass, or drilling or cutting for hardware placement, robots hit their marks with incredible accuracy every time. This impacts material placement and quantity, providing maximum strength and beauty for minimal weight. It guarantees exact fit and alignment, ensuring a tighter build with more exact tolerances and greatly improving performance.

Intent to push the boundaries of traditional yacht design, Sanlorenzo literally brought on board modern design principles of home living with the SX line, whose principal design aesthetic is that of a megayacht that feels like an open loft. A central component to the SX88’s design was a continuous flow from stern to bow, replete with an open kitchen adjacent to the formal dining area, a main living area with wide glass walls overlooking the sea and a seamless transition from interior to exterior. Aft of the main-deck living area, and down five easily negotiated steps, the open cockpit/beach club area accommodates a multitude of toys, including a tender, jet ski and sea bobs. The crane to move these watercrafts is elegantly disguised in the prolonged profile of the handrail, with no visual disturbance to the SX88’s eye-catching profile. Once the watercrafts have been effortlessly deployed, the wide stern area offers a best-in-class 323-square-feet of beach club space, shaded by umbrellas and furnished to enjoy life to the finest—at the water's edge. A testament to the SX88’s megayacht DNA, the only steering position is on the upper deck, with a reverse angled windshield and 9-foot-long side windows that can be lowered completely, making you one with your surroundings in a superb lounge area. A dedicated lounging area aft is left open to the elements yielding stunning views and alfresco dining.

Her hull and deck are all built using Sabre Yacht’s VIP resin infusion process. This method of molding fiberglass parts is cleaner and greener: emissions of VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) are dramatically reduced making our work environment better for our associates and the air in which we live and boat, cleaner. The infused composite parts are stronger, provide better durability and vessel integrity and yet they are lighter which lowers fuel costs. Her pod drive train offer quieter operation, better fuel economy than straight shafts and an unequaled ease of handling around the docks coupled with the joy stick and a Sky Hook feature that allows for easy deployment of fenders and lines prior to docking or just waiting for that bridge to open. She can cruise at speeds up to 30 knots while sound levels at cruise aboard the Sabre 48 Salon Express are an incredible low 74 Dba. Sabre is known to do an incredible job with their sound attenuation.Contact the listing broker, Scott Lucas, for additional information.

This success came from the blend of many practical design choices such as the full beam salon, main level galley, covered cockpit, raised comfortable pilothouse, all while fitting three staterooms and two heads. This particular vessel shows care and lighter use. There have been significant improvements made to the boat such as the hull extended to create a longer waterline while providing additional lift and flotation aft. The increased floatation and waterline minimizes the impact of the convenient placement of the davit and tender aft. Another significant improvement to the boat is the custom, professionally executed fully enclosed upper bridge. This provides a comfortable and protected year round helm at the elevated position, the work on this addition is very well done. Although a well known design, the modifications and equipment do make this a unique offering. This is a perfect set up for extended time aboard. The owners plans have changed making this West Hawk available just in time for the cruising season.

Jeanneau Leader 10.5 S2 LEADER 10.5 S2 - In a totally revised version inspired by the new 12.5, the NEW Leader 10.5 Series 2 replaces the previous generation 10.5 launched five years ago.

The forward cockpit now has 3 integrated chaise lounges that are safe and comfortable for seating underway or at anchor. Move to the back of the boat and the cockpit brings incredible versatility to cater to the needs of the entire family spending a day on the water or a couple off to explore for a long weekend. The outdoor galley located just behind the helm seats faces the cockpit seating and includes a fridge, electric grill, sink, and either a livewell or additional storage. Optional flip-down benches on either side create a U for the days when you feel like entertaining! A key feature of this new Leader 10.5 is the standard opening terrace on port, equipped with an optional ladder and guardrails; it will prove to be the perfect spot to jump off the boat from. Finally, its oversized, stylish, and fully equipped optional T-Top will provide you the shade and the functionality you need for an awesome day on the water.

The Sabre 43 is a blank-sheet design that remains true to her Downeast heritage without stinting on modernization and innovation. She boasts a sleek new mast design, expansive fixed-glazed windows, and sloping deck rails, all of which contribute to her striking nouveau-vintage silhouette. Owners will appreciate her contemporary Downeast proportions, with sweeping lines and fresh angles contained in a vessel that, nevertheless, remains recognizably a Sabre. Beneath her classic appearance, owners will discover the technology and features of a much larger yacht. The new 43 Salon Express will be the first full-network Sabre below 58-feet. As a result, owners can not only check critical functions and control any circuit on the boat from either the helm MFDs or iPad mini but also control the “mode of operation” or “scene” – setting the lighting and circuit configuration of the boat with the simple touch of a button. Remote access to these components, as well as GPS monitoring, geofencing, trip logging, and NMEA 2000-based alarms, are available via cell phone through the included Sentinel Telematics feature. Highlights include a spacious salon with two banks of seating over six feet in length and a half-up galley that incorporates all the amenities of a modern kitchen without wasting an inch of precious storage volume. Below deck, a versatile hybrid lounge functions as guest berth, private retreat, or home office, depending on her owners’ needs. Her master stateroom is iconic Sabre, featuring an island berth and numerous storage compartments, all in warm American cherry. Finally, an adaptable utility room beneath the salon sole provides space for various supplemental storage and appliance solutions, including a side-by-side washer and dryer, wine cooler, or storage lockers.

Above, the flybridge control station of the Sea Ray 560 Sedan Bridge is protected by a windscreen, and surrounds the captain with a full array of instrumentation and standard Raytheon electronics.

Everybody on board has a great view from the forward and aft bench seating. They are also spoiled by a close-at-hand wetbar and entertainment center complete with refrigerator and ice maker. The full fiberglass hardtop with enclosure and electronics box helps make sure everyone on the flybridge stays comfortable while underway, especially when the standard 24,000 BTU air conditioning system is running.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. : As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. : As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. : Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* : Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. : Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception. Given by the National Marine Manufacturer Association, the CSI Award recognizes manufacturers who receive exceptional satisfaction scores for the boat, engine, & dealer experience.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/2024-bennington-26-lxsfb-8860666/ ,/[..]/, 2024 Bennington 26 LXSFB26ft ,/[..]/, Your eye for excellence and aversion to compromise are true to spec. How do we know? Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating. Our ergonomic design and a blend of five compressions of high-density foam provide the perfect combination of support and comfort. From design elements like integrated self-draining channels to the selection of materials, our furniture is engineered to resist moisture and mildew. With the finest craftsmen and first-class upholstery, Bennington is known for its durable and luxurious interiors. Shown below, Simtex™ is a soft to the touch, easy to clean, premium vinyl also found in world-class yachts. When buying a new Bennington, our customers receive an industry-leading lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, giving you and your family the protection and assurance you deserve. Here at Bennington, we provide you with the finest built pontoon boats in the marketplace and want you, our valued customer, to know that we stand behind that commitment with the industry's strongest warranty protection. Under the lifetime structural + 10-year bow-to-stern warranty, we cover 100% materials, parts, and labor with no pro-rating, no third-party hand-offs, no warranty transfer fee, and no "read between the lines" statements to leave you second-guessing. As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the structure, pontoons, gates, channels, motor mount & rotomold seat frames. If anything goes wrong, we will fix it. Season after season, your Bennington will be ready. : As an owner of a new Bennington, you receive a Limited Lifetime Warranty on the 7-ply, pressure-treated, marine-grade decking. Since they fasten the rails & deck directly through the understructure, Bennington decks flex less & will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment. : As the original owner of a new Bennington, the first ten years are covered directly by Bennington. All materials and workmanship are covered by us, including flooring, electronics, and upholstery. No hassles, no worries, no hand-offs—It's Simple. Your dealer will register the warranty for you upon delivery of your new boat. The engine manufacturer's stated warranty covers your engine. : Bennington warranties are transferable through your local Bennington dealer, adding to the resale value of your boat. The warranty period begins on the original owner's new boat purchase date. Suppose the boat is sold during its warranty period. In that case, the standard warranty coverage will carry over to the new owner for the remainder of the original 10-year warranty—once the warranty is transferred through an authorized Bennington dealer.* : Bennington doesn't hand off warranty responsibilities to its suppliers. When it comes to warranty claims, your Bennington dealer will take care of it directly with Bennington. After all, no one cares more about your satisfaction than Bennington does. Bennington boats carry the same valuable warranty, whether it's the first day or the last day of the warranty period. Bennington does not use a declining scale of coverage in its warranty, also known as pro-rating. Bennington dealers receive 100% of the retail shop labor rate for warranty repairs. This ensures that your warranty work is a priority & completed quickly with your satisfaction in mind. : Bennington has earned the Customer Service Index (CSI) award for "Excellence in Customer Satisfaction," an industry-leading 23 times-every year since its inception. Given by the National Marine Manufacturer Association, the CSI Award recognizes manufacturers who receive exceptional satisfaction scores for the boat, engine, & dealer experience. A great place to start when researching what’s the right Bennington for you and your boating family is to explore our luxury pontoon boat lineup and product offerings. From our entry-level S Series to our flagship QX models; our fleet of boats are designed to fit various use cases, luxurious finishes, and feature options to suit your needs.

Because we are built the same way. Your drive to exceed expectations at every opportunity - it's what makes us who we are, as well. While other manufacturers screw their hulls together Bennington uses our exclusive THRU-BOLT™ technology on each and every hull. This system ensures far less flex, providing a stable ride for years of boating pleasure and safety. With a combined experience of over 100 years, our team lives by the philosophy of using the best materials and never cutting corners. We proudly stand behind each and every Bennington with our no hassle factory-backed 10-year bow-to-stern warranty while covering the deck and hull for a lifetime. Our thicker cross channels provide more vertical strength than the typical channels found on most pontoons. This combined with our extruded M-deck brackets and fanged elevator bolted deck construction minimizes twisting and provides the most solid, quiet pontoon ride in the industry. Fully-welded aluminum construction ensures a far stronger and more rigid structure over the faster and cheaper method of single or even double surface welds. When it comes to comfort on the water, Bennington offers the industry’s most sophisticated seating.

https://www.yachtworld.com/yacht/2013-icon-motor-yacht-8865886/ ,/[..]/, 2013 Icon Motor Yacht Party Girl205ft ,/[..]/, 2013 Icon Yachts ''PARTY GIRL" Party Girl is a 205' Icon, six-deck, 8 stateroom oceangoing motor yacht with exterior design by Redman Whitely Dixon and an exclusive interior by award winning Cristiano Gatto Design Team. A few incredible features includes an on-deck master with a staircase to the master lounge with 180 view (This can also act as a VIP). She also includes one of the largest beaches of any boat of its size, which includes a passage hallway to the lower accommodations and one of the largest tender and toy garage made. The fundamental layout reflects the owner's need to create wide entertainment areas, both formal and informal, to share with his guests, but it also reflects his need to allow himself roomy spaces for his privacy. This double aspect is reflected in the 55' (17m) long main salon, or in the outdoor and indoor salons, and, on the other hand, in the owner's cabin, which is distributed in two decks with a direct link to a panoramic salon lounge/VIP for for moments of family privacy. Refined is the choice of the woods divided in three different materials like mahogany, rosewood, dark walnut on the main deck salon and guest cabins; ebony and Canaletto walnut on the owner areas and upper deck salon, all with high gloss finishing; wenge and teak for the bridge deck and beach club areas, treated with semi-gloss and brushed finishing; all those balanced by the presence of natural stones such as the Sahara desert stone, black meteorite marble, travertine and dark brown Emperador marble. The yacht's interior style is mainly influenced by the design of the early 20th century but has been enriched with a series of furniture, lighting fixtures and materials to make her luxurious and user-friendly at the same time. Special attention has been placed on the decor, special fixtures and custom made items, manufactured by all companies involved in the project specifically for this yacht. Venini and Seguso custom made lamps in Murano glass; lighting fixtures such as spotlights, wall lamps, reading lights designed and customized for the project in marine high-gloss stainless steel; bamboo fiber and silk hand­ made carpet with custom design realized by Tai ping and Olivier Treutlein; soft upholstery furniture and the main loose furniture realized by Donghia with natural fibers mainly linen and silk; several furniture pieces have been built like free-standing but, in reality, is fully custom made using precious veneer and rare materials like parchment. To appreciate the level of customization that was achieved on this project, you have to know that the designer was involved in every single detail, including the visible and invisible hardware such as handles, knobs, hinges, etc. Also the exteriors have been enriched with custom furniture and fabric selected to match with the interior's mood. Also, all linens, towels, tablecloths, etc., are produced by Italian artisans to fulfill the tailor-made experience. A special feature in the main salon dining area is the wine room with glass plate panels realized from a Venetian artisan just for the yacht. In the same room you may notice the custom ceiling lamp "Tappeto Volante" from Venini which is 7 meters in length. An immense portoro marble slab is installed on the main deck lobby; the stairs that goes through the four decks have been completely covered with leather produced by craftsmen from Turin. All the marbles have been directly selected from the caves, with a particular attention to the desert stone that is treated with a special natural finishing. Special flooring is featured in massive ebony, leather and carpets in the owner areas, especially the one in the observation lounge, private owner salon. Rare material like parchment has been used to cover the ceiling and the walls in the salon's. Fully custom leather has been used to produce all venetian blinds and interlaced leather on the walls; all the leather on board is customized and produced to match the color and function to the highest quality standard. Everything from the lower deck guest cabins to the owner's area, salons to the exteriors, are arranged to fulfill an experience of materials and colors, so one may fully appreciate the high level yachting lifestyle throughout the vessel.

Aside from the additional two feet of hull length, Bayliner designers reversed the radar arch on the 4788 and softened the flybridge profile for a sleeker, more contemporary appearance. Inside, the versatile pilothouse floorplan of the original 4588 was continued in the 4788 with very few changes. The L-shaped lounge was moved to starboard in the salon, and the increased hull length of the 4788 can be seen in the enlarged galley and salon dimensions. Two of the three staterooms have double berths, and the third cabin— which opens to the master stateroom—has a settee with hinged upper and lower berths. Visibility from the raised pilothouse is excellent. The cockpit is sheltered from the sun by a bridge overhang, and port/starboard pilothouse doors provide quickaccess to the foredeck. In addition to the 3 stateroom / 2 head layout, great pilothouse space and visibility and roomy salon with adjacent galley that everyone loves, this boat features: Coverd Moorage Kept much of it's life until recently Twin 310hp Hino diesel engines with 2290 hours Underhulls for an improved, more efficient and stable ride 3 Stateroom / 2 Head configuration with generous salon / galley on same level and large pilothouse with dual opening side doors Updated salon upholstery Webasto Hydronic Diesel Furnace Westerbeke generator with 980 hours Newer Garmin Radar / GPS / Plotter Raymarine GPS / Plotter 11' Rendova RIB with center console, 25hp Yamaha 4-Stroke Outboard, engine gauges, plotter, custom SS arch and lifting harness Stainless Steel Custom Staples for ease and safety in docking and boarding Many more updates!

You don't need wings...just the help of the Robalo 246 Cayman Sky Deck. Step aboard and you will find an expertly-crafted second station that gives you more control than ever before, extending your vantage point and taking your angling adventure to new heights--literally. The 246 builds upon the tradition of Robalo's go-anywhere Caymans, a family of bay boats that are just as comfortable on offshore adventures as they are at shallow nooks and crannies by the coast. Ample deck space gives you room to welcome the whole crew on board, a perk that the addition of the Sky Deck only amplifies. Built-in storage for everything from rods to live bait to tackle is abundant, so you're never limited by the capacity of your ride. That convenience extends up to the second station, where stainless-steel drink holders make it easy for you to kick back and stay perched there however long you like. On the 246 Cayman Sky Deck, you never have to rush...but when you want to, you can count on a ride that's quick and smoother than ever. Fishing can be challenging...but who says it has to be uncomfortable? The transom on your 246 Cayman Sky Deck comes complete with touches that help to provide your best-ever angling experience. Non-skid walkways keep you upright, even as you fight to land the big one. For even more customizable comfort, the aft jump seat can be turned up or down, turning downtime to game time in mere seconds. Twin, LED-lit storage compartments on either side of the transom ensure that your gear is never more than arm's reach away.

She enjoyed her best years during the 1970s when powerboats, with their big fuel-guzzling engines, were out of favor. There were several updates to the 34 over the years. Prior to 1975 she was built with a plywood house and a fiberglass cloth overlay. Until 1985 the decks were teak-planked and fastened through fiberglass to a balsa sub-deck—a constant source of deck leaks—and after 1985 the 34 was constructed of solid fiberglass. The flybridge was revised in 1991, and the teak window frames were eliminated in 1992. Below decks, the allteak interior is arranged with small staterooms fore and aft, two heads and a very practical passageway from the aft stateroom to the cockpit. A lower helm was standard, and a sliding salon door provides easy access to the deck. No one will ever confuse the Marine Trader 34 with a Grand Banks when it comes to quality.Show More ,/[..]/, US$84,000 ,/[..]/, 1977 ,/[..]/, Marine Trader ,/[..]/, 34 ,/[..]/, Trawler ,/[..]/, 33ft ,/[..]/, Diesel ,/[..]/, Fiberglass ,/[..]/, Allied Marine - Stuart

The 2013 Cabo 40 HTX is one of the most popular models out on the water and is the best-priced on the market at $579,999. She won't last long. She underwent her 1000 hour service, As you can see, the bottom paint has been applied. Both pod drives were removed the 1000 hour O-ring kits, studs nuts and washers and filters also fluids replaced. The propellers were shined up and balanced. She was buffed and waxed inside and out ready for her new owner. The luxury interior of the 40 Hardtop Express (HTX) suggests champagne, prawns, classical music, monogrammed dock-siders and day cruising. Graham from Game and Leisure Boats even admitted that the helm chairs are the price of a small car! You can imagine my surprise when we purred away from the dock, jumped to the plane and blasted out of the Gold Coast Seaway at 30 eye-watering knots. This girl had some serious power hidden away. There's a lot of boat tucked away for a 40-footer, especially down below. Classically styled, the lower decks feature a luxury L-shaped lounge, bedding fit for a king, large kitchen, practical head and lots of storage. No matter where you looked there was a new cupboard, hatch or hidden nook with an abundance of space.When I first ventured into the cabin I was immediately surprised by its depth. The extra headroom, something which is common to the range, gives the perception of space. No doubt this goes down well in Texas but even here in Queensland, a few larger-than-life gents will appreciate a boat which has made allowances for real-sized people.The aforementioned luxury L-shaped lounge is the first thing you come across on entry and it's big enough for all the troops. Double points also for not obstructing your path to the rest of the cabin. Wall-mounted opposite, is a flatscreen TV, perfect for nights onboard.To be fair, a full complement eating dinner in the cabin would be a tricky proposition, as the table wouldn't really be suitable for more than two people at a time. The kitchen on the other hand is big enough for four burly blokes to make peanut butter sandwiches side-by-side or maybe a handful of chefs shucking oysters.Back out on the deck sore necks from watching lures will be a thing of the past with another winning feature, an aft facing bench seat complete with foldout footrest and yes, it does have plenty of drink holders.Particularly importantly, a whopping bait tank is located slap, bang in the middle of the transom (adjacent to the door). While you may think it will get in the way, it actually doesn't protrude much and suits the boat nicely. An internal LED light looks pretty swish and it also makes short work of finding your live bait in the dark.Show More ,/[..]/, US$579,999 ,/[..]/, 2013 ,/[..]/, Cabo ,/[..]/, 40 Express ,/[..]/, Sport Fishing ,/[..]/, 40ft ,/[..]/, Diesel ,/[..]/, Fiberglass ,/[..]/, Modified Vee ,/[..]/, Engel and Volkers Yachting Olde Naples Florida

Bow features expansive seating and storage, while the cockpit includes a new aft-facing couch with optional removable table and optional Summer Kitchen, perfect for entertaining. Yes, you can cut a Boston Whaler in two and drive away in the half with the engine. But unsinkability means more than just the unmatched safety of Unibond™ hull construction. It means smart design, high-quality construction and forward-thinking technology. It means premium experiences and comfort year in and year out, whether you’re fishing, cruising or both. It means having the Core Confidence to take on anything from the shallows to the roughest offshore water without worrying about a thing. We’re committed to creating boats that are purposefully engineered to be safe, functional and low-maintenance, while they deliver a lifetime of carefree pleasure. Learn how the latest Dauntless models reflect this ideology. Whalers set the standard not only for their reliable performance and innovative engineering, but also for their style. Our long lists of patents proves it. Boston Whaler partners with leading suppliers to offer the latest technology and provide the best possible boating experience. Every component on a Boston Whaler is purposefully selected to enhance your time on the water, from the stereo speakers that play your boating soundtrack, to the canvas that provides welcome shade, to the navigation and propulsion equipment that ensures superior performance. By partnering with fellow leaders in the marine industry, Whaler is able to offer the highest quality components available — for the best quality boating experiences imaginable. Boston Whaler has achieved legendary status by delivering on-water experiences that have exceeded all expectations for 60 years. The legend continues today as customers pass down their Whalers to their children and grandchildren, adding to the vast collection of treasured memories. When you own a Whaler, you’re a part of something special, something decades in the making. A lifetime of fun and a strong community come standard when you’re an owner. Just ask any Whaler enthusiast. Owning a Whaler means so much more than owning a boat; it means gaining access to an incomparable on-water lifestyle. Discover the fullness of the #WhalerLife, and add your moments and memories to the mix. A tender boat’s primary purpose is to ferry passengers and supplies to and from a larger boat. Often referred to as a “dinghy,” a tender can be as simple as a rowboat or a rigid inflatable boat (RIB), or as sophisticated as powerboat. A tender generally features a shallow draft so it can safely go ashore while the larger boat stays out at anchor. To serve its function well, a tender boat must also be easily towable, unfailingly reliable and comfortable for passengers. After all, the tender sets the tone for a day on the water; the right tender can enhance that day greatly. Built to withstand the rigors of hauling and towing on long ocean voyages, Boston Whalers will never crack or cave under heavy use. Professional captains around the world rave about Whaler features like pressure-rated tow eyes, premium components and low-maintenance operation. As a tender boat, a Boston Whaler Super Sport is a versatile, reliable option, offering a spacious layout to accommodate multiple passengers, and purposeful amenities for fishing, cruising and lounging. Whaler’s legendary quality sets them far above a typical dinghy, making it easy to choose between inflatable and Unsinkable. Boston Whaler provides the safest, easiest to own, most exciting boats on the water. Since our founding over 60 years ago, we have conceived and built peerless designs that meet boaters’ diverse and changing needs. Only Whaler can bring you a legendary, innovative boat that is engineered for a lifetime of enjoyment and dependability. Only Whaler can bring you the Unsinkable Legend™. The true legend of a Whaler lies in the possibilities it empowers, the enjoyment it evokes. With a storied history and a forward-looking present, Boston Whaler is in a class all its own. Here’s where Boston Whaler came from and where it’s headed. The man behind the Unsinkable Legend™ was always pushing boundaries—from his out-of-the-box ideas to his torture tests proving Whaler’s toughness. Our future looks nothing short of dazzling. Improved facilities and technology have allowed for more and larger boats—including the flagship 420 Outrage. This monstrous earth mover makes waves and rocky shorelines seem kind of wimpy. Every Whaler is built for maximum durability, dependability and structural soundness, so you can tackle any water with absolute confidence. Boston Whaler has delivered for decades what no other boat can. When boats were expected simply to float, Boston Whaler proved they could be unsinkable. Where most fishing boats lack comfort, and most pleasure boats lack fishing features, Boston Whaler proves you can have both at the most premium level. No matter what initially pulls you to the water – fishing, cruising, or water sports – your Whaler will draw you back over and over again.
